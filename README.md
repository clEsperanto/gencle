# GenCle : clEsperanto code generator

clEsperanto auto-generation code library and scripts. A large part of the python, java, and cpp user API are autogenerated from the low-level library CLIc.
This repository hold python package and script collection to parse the documentation of the CLIc library and generate the code and documentation blocks of the following upstream libraries:
* [`pyclesperanto`](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto) :snake:
* [`ClesperantoJ`](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clesperantoj_prototype) :coffee:
* [`Clesperanto`]() :rocket:

## Install

As this is a very specific usage package and not relevant for high-level user of clEsperanto, we did not deploy any package. 
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/clesperanto/gencle
```
Create a environement for running the jupyter notebook
```
mamba create -n gencle jupyterlab
mamba activate gencle

```
Open and follow one the notebook.
